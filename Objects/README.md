Objects have many use cases in JavaScript. The purpose of this section is to show how they can be used.

* Aggregates - A aggregate of objects.
* Maps - A "dictionary" mapping from keys to values
* Object Orientated Programming - Using objects for object-orientated design by taking advantage of inner functions (closures).
